Attempt to summarize the changes that was needed to add a custom vehicle.

UE4:
    Project Admin:
    Carla.Build.cs and Carla.uplugin
    Add the plugin


    Plugin c++:
    VTMForCarla Plugin
    Here is the custom simulator, due to some issues with boost and other dependencies, we cant run it in the carla plugin and we run in its on plugin.
    Link between compiled library and outside

    Carla c++:
    VTM.cpp+VTM.h in vehicle
    These are the new pawns to replace BasicPawnOf Carla.
    This is due to us needing to run c++ code to fetch how the vehicle parts should be placed.
    The code checks a json for vtm parameters and structures vehicle accordingly

    VTMMovementComponent.cpp+etc in Vehicle/MovementComponent
    The main interface between plugin and Carla.

    CarlaServer
    Row 1775:
    enable_custom_simulator
    Calls to the actor to EnableCustomSimulator 

    CarlaActor
    EnableCustomSimulator
    creates a VTMMovementComponent and assigns as movement controller.

    Blueprints:
    VehicleFactory
    We need additional option to cast to VTM instead of BaseVehiclePawn

    CustomVeh
    Custom Vehicle. Inherits most from VTM. Assings some pseudo controls to satisfy default movement controller.

Python:
    carla\LibCarla\source\carla
        Quite a few addons is needed for server communication, search for "EnableChronoPhysics" and "enable_chrono_physics"
        We need one of each for EnableCustomSimulator
    carla\PythonAPI\




Sidenote:
    When building engine, make sure to build CrashReporterClientEditor in shipping, so just change from development that carla wants to shipping, rightclick CrashReporterClientEditor and build.
